<h1>Infinitives</h1> 
<p>The infinitive (el infinitivo) is the most basic form of a Spanish verb. Verbs in the infinitive form are not conjugated and do not indicate anything about who is performing an action or at what point in time the action is taking place.</p>
<p>In English, infinitive verbs are preceded by the word to, as in to speak, to read, or to write.
In Spanish, infinitives are only one word and end in either -ar, -er, or -ir, as in hablar, leer, and escribir </p>

<h1> Verb Stems</h1>
<p>Many verb tenses use a form of the infinitive as the stem to which verb conjugation endings are attached. In general, for regular verbs, you simply need to remove the infinitive ending (-ar, -er, or -ir) to find the stem, and then you can the add specific endings needed to give tense/subject information.</p>
