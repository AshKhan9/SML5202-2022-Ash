<h1>Caramel Cake Recipe</h1> 
<p>Need to bake a cake on a short notice? Then try this caramel cake recipe:</p>
<p> This requires minimal effort</p>

  <h1>Ingredients</h1> 
<ul>
  <li> 225g softened salted butter, plus extra for the tins </li>
  <li> 125g golden caster sugar </li>
  <li> 100g light brown soft sugar </li>
  <li> 1 tsp vanilla extract </li>
  <li> 4 large eggs </li>
  <li> 225g self raising flour </li>
  <li> 2 tbsp milk </li>
  <li> toffee, chocolate or caramel pieces, to decorate </li>
</ul>
<h1>Icing Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
  <li>200g softened salted butter</li>
  <li>400g icing sugar (golden icing sugar if you can find it – it adds a golden colour and caramel flavour)</li>
  <li>70g caramel sauce, dulce de leche or caramel spread, plus 3 tbsp to serve</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Instructions</h1>
<p>Step 1:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter two 20cm springform tins and line the bases with baking parchment</li>
 </ul>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Beat the butter and both sugars in a bowl with an electric whisk for a few mins until lighter in colour and fluffy. Add the vanilla and the eggs, one at a time, adding a spoonful of flour and beating in between each egg. Add the remaining flour and milk. Divide between the cake tins and bake for 25-30 mins until they’re golden, spring back when pressed, and a skewer comes out clean when inserted into the middle. Cool in the tins for a few mins, then tip out and leave to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 3:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Meanwhile, for the icing, put the butter and icing sugar in a bowl and whisk for a few mins until light and airy. Whisk in the caramel briefly, adding 1 tbsp of boiling water to loosen, if needed. Set aside until the sponges are completely cool before assembling, or the icing will melt.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 4:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Use half the icing to sandwich the cakes together, then spread the remainder over the top, smoothing it out with a knife or the back of a spoon. Leave in a cool place until ready to serve. Drizzle with the 3 tbsp extra sauce (warm briefly in the microwave if it’s a little stiff), allowing some to drip down the sides if you like, and scatter over the toffee, chocolate or caramel pieces to serve. Edible glitter, birthday candles or sparklers, optional.</li>
</ul>
