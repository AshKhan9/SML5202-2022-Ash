      <div class="fw-bold">Nouns</div>
Nouns in Spanish are either masculine or feminine. This is indicated by the article (el or la) that is used with the noun, as well as by the ending of the noun itself. For example, the noun "el libro" (the book) is masculine, while "la mesa" (the table) is feminine.    </div>

      <div class="fw-bold">Adjectives</div>
Adjectives in Spanish must match the noun they are describing in gender and number. For example, "el perro grande" (the big dog), "la casa peque単a" (the small house).    </div>
