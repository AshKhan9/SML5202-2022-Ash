  <h1> Learn Basic Spanish Greetings</h1>
  <p>In English you can say YOU to practically any person or group of people, whether you know them or not. In Spanish, however, there are many ways to say YOU, and they vary depending on the formality of the relationship between the speaker(s) and listener(s)</p>

  <ol class="list-group list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
    <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
      <div class="fw-bold">Tu</div>
You should only use tú when talking to people you know well, especially those that are the same age as you or younger. Tú can be used to speak directly to children, close relatives, friends, peers, or pets.
    For example: ¿Vas tú a la fiesta esta noche? (Are you going to the party tonight?) </div>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">

    <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
